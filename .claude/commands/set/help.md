### Worktree & Team (`set-core`)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_worktrees()` | List all git worktrees across projects |
| `get_activity(change_id)` | Get agent activity from local worktrees |
| `get_team_status()` | Show which team members are active and what they're doing |

## Common Workflows

**New feature (full workflow):**
`set-new my-feature` → `/opsx:ff` → `/opsx:apply` → `/opsx:verify` → `/opsx:archive` → `set-merge my-feature`

**Quick fix (skip artifacts):**
`set-new quick-fix` → implement → `set-merge quick-fix`

**Explore before deciding:**
`/opsx:explore` → think/investigate → `/opsx:new` when ready

**Parallel work:**
`set-new feature-a` + `set-new feature-b` → work in separate worktrees → merge independently
